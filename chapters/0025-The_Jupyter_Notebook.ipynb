    "## Project Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Jupyter website:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Jupyter includes more than just the Jupyter Notebook, but we'll focus on the notebook here to begin with. To quote again from the website:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have gained real popularity in the past few years for academics, researchers, data scientists, machine learning engineers, and much of the python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So, why Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python and R, and also a homage to Galileo's notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter).\n",

    "## A tour of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The jupyter notebook opens in the default web browser of the host machine. The notebooks are designed to work on the latest versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox.\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser window always includes the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A notebook url\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_url.png\" alt=\"url\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the your localhost or `127.0.0.1` i.e. your local computer on which the jupyter server is running (more on that later), and then the path of the file you are working on, starting at the location where you launched the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A notebook header\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_header.png\" alt=\"header\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The header is where you'll see the Jupyter logo, the name of the file you are working on (without it's \\*.ipynb suffix), the time of the last checkpoint, the language logo for the current kernel and the logout button (this will not stop the server)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebook menus\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_menus.png\" alt=\"menus\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The menus include the standare File, Edit and View menus, but also Cell, Kernel, Widgets and Help. Cell options focus on running the cells in your notebook or executing the code; Kernel options control the instance of the programming language that you are using (the 'engine' behind the notebook); and Widgets control the state of interactive objects in the notebook. The Help menu offers quick access to keyboard shortcuts (that you can edit) as well as important documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebook buttons\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_buttons.png\" alt=\"buttons\"/>\n",
    "\n",

    "- Markdown cells\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_markdown.png\" alt=\"markdown\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.\n",

    "- Code cells and their outputs\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_code_&_output.png\" alt=\"code\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why (and when) to use the notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "The jupyter notebook is perhaps best used for prototyping given that cells can be run very quickly and changes in data can immediately be translated to outputs through code cells. It is also perfectly suited to research publications as it provides a perfect record of the data, any transformations performed, and the results. A pitfall in science is the lack of reproducability and the jupyter notebook provides and elegant solution to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is of course also a fantastic teaching medium specifically as the code cells can be written and run live, any errors are rendered directly in the notebook, and outputs can be displayed inline in the notebook or saved to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context it is therefore also a wonderful learning platform as code can be quickly written and run.\n",
