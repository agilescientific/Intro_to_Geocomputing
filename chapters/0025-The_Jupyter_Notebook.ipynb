    "## Project Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Jupyter website:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Jupyter includes more than just the Jupyter Notebook, but we'll focus on the notebook here to begin with. To quote again from the website:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have gained real popularity in the past few years for academics, researchers, data scientists, machine learning engineers, and much of the python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So, why \"Jupyter\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python and R, and also a homage to Galileo's notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A tour of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The jupyter notebook opens in the default web browser of the host machine. The notebooks are designed to work on the latest versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox.\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser window always includes the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A notebook url\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_url.png\" alt=\"url\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook url shows your localhost or `127.0.0.1` i.e. your local computer, and the port on which the jupyter server is running (more on that later). Next, the path of the file you are working on is shown, starting at the location where you launched the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A notebook header\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_header.png\" alt=\"header\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The header is where you'll see the Jupyter logo, the editable name of the file you are working on (without it's \\*.ipynb suffix), the time of the last checkpoint, the language logo for the current kernel and the logout button (this will not stop the server).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook menus\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_menus.png\" alt=\"menus\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The menus include standard `File`, `Edit`, `View` and `Insert` menus, but also `Cell`, `Kernel`, `Widgets` and `Help`. `Cell` options focus on running the cells in your notebook or executing the code; `Kernel` options control the instance of the programming language that you are using (the 'engine' behind the notebook); and `Widgets` control the state of interactive objects in the notebook. The `Help` menu offers quick access to keyboard shortcuts (that you can edit) as well as links directly to important and useful documentation. On the same line as the menus, you also see any server messages, the `Not Trusted` or `Trusted` mention, the current `mode` (edit and command) and finally, the name of your current `kernel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook buttons\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_buttons.png\" alt=\"buttons\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The buttons offer some quick mouse access to some of the menus options (Save a checkpoint, add a new cell, cut, copy or paste a cell, reorder cells, cell executions commands and cell type selection), you can perform most of these actions with the keyboard too (hit `Esc + h` to access the keyboard shortcuts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown cells\n",
    "> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit [John Gruber's original page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and a [Getting started with Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_markdown.png\" alt=\"markdown\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to include markdown cells interspersed between code cells is one of the strengths of the notebooks as this allows the user to document their work and include full text formatting, tables, [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code cells and their outputs\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/notebook_in_out.png\" alt=\"In_out_example\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This of course is the heart of the notebooks, whichever kernel you are using (whichever programming language you use), it's in the code cells that you will write, test, debug and run your code. The execution order of the code cells is recorded as an integer on the left inside the `In [ ]` block. Pay attention to this order as it is easy to mix things up and end up with strange bugs due to out-of-sequence code execution. If the code has an output, it will be displayed in the `Out [ ]` block of the cell. Also note that some cells will show no output number but simply show an output below the input cell, for example for print statements and graphical displays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why (and when) to use the notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "The jupyter notebook is perhaps best used for prototyping given that cells can be run very quickly and changes in data can immediately be translated to outputs through code cells. It is also perfectly suited to research publications as it provides a perfect record of the data, any transformations performed, and the results. A pitfall in science is the lack of reproducability and the jupyter notebook provides and elegant solution to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is of course also a fantastic teaching medium specifically as the code cells can be written and run live, any errors are rendered directly in the notebook, and outputs can be displayed inline in the notebook or saved to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context it is therefore also a wonderful learning platform as code can be quickly written and run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cell types\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell type can be changed from the dropdown menu or using the keyboard shortcuts (see `Esc + h`). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Code cells: for code\n",
    "- Markdown cells: for formatted text, tables, equations, etc.\n",
    "- Raw NBConvert: to render different code formats into HTML or LaTeX by Sphinx\n",
    "- Heading: deprecated, write your headings in Markdown cells using # characters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kernels\n",
    "### What are kernels?\n",
    "Kernels can be thought of as \"programming languages\" that may be used in jupter notebooks, more specifically the [documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) tell us that:\n",
    "> Kernels are programming language specific processes that run independently and interact with the Jupyter Applications and their user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often use a python kernel but **many** other [kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) are available. If an `environment` contains a programming language such as python, this kernel can be [installed](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/kernel_install.html) in the [`kernelspec`](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kernels.html#kernelspecs) (the 'list' of kernels available to the jupyter notebook server) with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install ipykernel\n",
    "$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name <myenv>\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Changing kernel\n",
    "You can check that a kernel is installed in your `kernelspec` by running this command in your terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ jupyter kernelspec list\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once a kernel is installed, you can select it `Kernel > Change Kernel > <your_kernel>`. Always check that the name of your chosen kernel appears on the right of the menu bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cells\n",
    "- running cells: cells are run or executed by pressing `Shift + Enter` to execute the cell *and move* to the next cell or `Ctrl + Enter` to execute *and keep focus* on that cell\n",
    "- cutting cells: cells can be cut by pressing the `cut` button or by hitting `x` in command mode (`Esc + x`)\n",
    "- copying cells: cells can be copied by pressing the `copy` button or by hitting `c` in command mode (`Esc + c`)\n",
    "- pasting cells: cells can be pasted below the current cell by pressing the `paste` button or by hitting `v` in command mode (`Esc + v`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other command mode options are available in the keyboard shortcuts (`Esc + h`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saving\n",
    "The jupyter notebook is saved automatically every 120 seconds by default so there is no need to worry about loosing work. However it is also possible to save `checkpoints` with `Ctrl + s`. These allow you to revert back to the state of the notebook at that save \n",
