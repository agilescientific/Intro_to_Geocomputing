    "We access the python REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) from the [CLI](0003-The_command_line_in_your_OS.ipynb) by running:\n",

    "This gives us access to a python interpreter where we can write simple python code either in the 'bare bones' python REPL or in the \"enhanced Interactive Python\" REPL that also gives us some interactive autocompletion and colour highlighting, this is the same interpreter as is used by the Jupyter project.\n",

    "### Running scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have written your own `module.py` scripts that you want to reuse, the obvious place is to run them from the CLI by simply passing the name of the `*.py` file to python. For example the file `hello.py` \n",

    "\n",
    "This project gives us access to python (and other languages) inside a web browser where we can run a terminal to interact with the OS, or create, edit and read `*.ipynb` files (ipython notebooks). These files consist of series of cells that can contain markdown text (text that can be formatted), code cells where python code can be executed, and output of cells either in text or image form. The notebooks can also be saved in multiple formats including *.ipynb, *.pdf and *.html for example.\n",

    "- a text editor\n",
    "- a terminal emulator\n",
    "- code debugging (break points)\n",
