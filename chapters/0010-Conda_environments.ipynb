    "# `conda` environments\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best things about Anaconda is `conda`, the Anaconda package manager. If there is one page in the conda docs that you should bookmark, it is [Managing environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). This page shows you all the commands you will need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create your first environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by creating an all-purpose scientific computing environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n myenv anaconda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hit return when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command creates a directory in your main `anaconda` folder. Inside it is an entire install of Python and all the libraries you install in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this environment, i.e. to have access to the libraries you installed, you need to 'activate' it, to do that you can run\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are 'inside' your environment, as long as you're in this command window. The prompt in your command window will change to remind you:\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(myenv) C:\\Users\\myuser>\n",
    "```\n",
    "On Mac/Linux:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(myenv) [user@host current_directory]$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can open another command window and run an entirely different environment in there. This can be really useful... and really confusing. Use sparingly until you're used to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing other packages\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install` and `pip install`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may wish to add additional packages to your environment, these are typically found either on the [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/) or on the [python package index](https://pypi.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases before installing new packages, ensure you have activated your target environment with `conda activate myenv` (this is where the packages will be installed). Then for packages found on the conda-forge run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install <package-name>`\n",
    "\n",
    "and for packages found on pypi run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install <package-name>`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environments for particular tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you don't want everything. Say you're writing a paper for the SEG annual meeting next year. Maybe you're going to demo some software you're making. To help others (and your future self!) reproduce your environment, you can just choose to install a more basic set of tools — just the ones you need. Perhaps it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create -n seg2019 python=3.6 numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sharing your env, or using someone else's\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practise to save the list of the packages you installed as well as their version numbers in a file that you can then reuse, this file is typically called `environment.yml`. As the suffix shows, it is formatted using [yml](https://yaml.org/). This is achieved with the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda env export > environment.yml`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then use this file to recreate your environment exactly 'as-is' on your computer or on any other that has conda installed with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda env create -f environment.yml`\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Updating](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#updating-an-environment) and [removing](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#removing-packages) packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally, you may want to update a specific package in your environment, to do this you should change it's version in the enviromnent.yml file and then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda env update --prefix ./env --file environment.yml  --prune`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to remove a package, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda remove -n myenv <package_to_remove>`\n",
    "\n",
    "or to remove several packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda remove -n myenv <package_A_to_remove> <package_B_to_remove>`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always list the content of an environment - and for example check that the package you wanted to remove is indeed gone with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda list`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Links - for print version\n",
