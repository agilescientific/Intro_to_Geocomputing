    "# The command line on your OS\n",
    "\n",
    "For scientists, working with Python *can be* all about the data. And as the data live on your hard drive, or on a network drive, on in the cloud, you'll very often need to communicate with your OS, your Operating System. As I write in late 2021, for over [70% of desktop users](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide), that will be a version of Microsoft Windows, for around 15% of users, that will be OS-X and the rest is a mix of operating systems. It should be noted however that this proportion changes sharply in the developer world, see for example the [Stack Overflow developer survey results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-op-sys-prof) or on servers, supercomputers or cloud infrastructure (see some [Mind-blowing Linux Statistics (Editor's Choice)](https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/linux-statistics/) for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "So with all that said, irrespective of your OS, you need to be able to interact with it fast and efficiently in a trackable and repeatable manner, and this is where the command line comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the command line?\n",
    "The command line, or CLI, is an *interface* of any type that allows the User to enter text commands and read outputs. These commands are parsed by the `shell` which actually processes them and outputs the results. There are many type of shells, for example: `cmd`, `PowerShell`, `sh`, `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `ksh`. The `anaconda prompt` which you may be familiar with, simply 'points to' or uses the default shell on your computer (`cmd` or `PowerShell` on Windows, `zsh` on Mac (starting with macOS Catalina) and `bash` or whichever other shell you choose to use in Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use the CLI?\n",
    "Clearly we cannot cover all of the shells out in the world, but luckily they behave essentially the same way, certainly for a beginner user. And the only differences to be aware of are between Windows and Unix-like systems (Mac or Linux), and some particularities of the `anaconda prompt`.\n",
