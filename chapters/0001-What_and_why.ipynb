    "# Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a great language for scientists to learn. Why? Reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's relatively easy to pick up. Relatedly: there is a lot of instructional material on the Internet, from tutorials to multi-week courses.\n",
    "- It's general purpose, so you can do almost anything with it. Compare this to, say, MATLAB, which is more specifically about science and engineering, or R, which is principally for statistics.\n",
    "- There are lots of libraries for it, giving you superpowers. These range from fundamental numerical libraries for, say, linear algebra, to high-level libraries for machine learning, signal processing,  or image analysis.\n",
    "- It's open source, which means you can read and extend all of its source code. It also means that, unlike MATLAB, it's free for everyone to use.\n",
    "- As a result of all this, it's very popular. Indeed, in 2018 it's the fastest growing language in the world, according to StackOverflow's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## In a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is...\n",
    "\n",
    "- ...not just a scripting language. You can write full-blown programs to do all sorts of things.\n",
    "- ...interpreted, not compiled. This has some advantages (the interactive console) and some disadvantages (speed).\n",
    "- ...strongly typed. In other words, types are enforced and never implicitly converted.\n",
    "- ...dynamically, implicitly typed — you don't have to declare variables.\n",
    "- ...case sensitive — var, Var and VAR are different variables.\n",
    "- ...object-oriented — everything is an object. But you can write procedural programs too.\n",
    "- ...supportive of functional and procedural programming styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know what some of this means — or what any of it means — don't worry. Some of it will only make sense to people who know other programming languages. Most of it you will come to understand as you learn more about Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a bit of insight into the philosophy of Python by reading the Easter egg mantra placed there by the Python developers in about 2001. Just `import this`:"
