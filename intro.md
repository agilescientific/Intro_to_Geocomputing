## Practical programming

### Writing code
- Text editors, IDES, Jupyter.
- Linting and PEP8.
- Documentation, testing, continuous integration.

### Version control
- Introduction to git and GitHub.
- - clone a project that interests you, and use it.
- - start a new repo for our well log class and get it set up.

### Test driven development
- Untested code is broken code.
- Writing tests.
- - write the first tests for our well log class.

### Documentation
- Writing self-documenting code: docstrings and comments.
- Supporting documents and notebooks.
- - document our well log class.

### Packaging
- Functions, files, modules, and packages â€” review.
- Setup.py, requirements.txt, PyPi, and everything else.
- Managing branches in git.

### Getting better
- Tips for becoming a better programmer.
- Online resources. Conferences and meetings.

### Other
- Containers, Docker, and developer operations.

## Coding style

For the book, could include this too if we wanted to.

- PEP8 all the way, more or less.
- Single quotes for identifiers (eg keys), double quotes for English, including docstrings.
- Lowercase variable names, except for classes.
- Spaces around =, except never as arguments.
- Spaces around operators unless things get out of hand, and not around `**`.
- Docstrings: always.
- No side effects, except plotting and file writing are ok.
- Named tuples... probably not in this book, but I like them.
- Type hints: jury is out. I like them...
